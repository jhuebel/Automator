# Automator

A cross-platform web application for managing and automating IaaS scripts. Built with ASP.NET Core 9 Blazor Server, it runs on Windows Server and all major Linux distributions.

## Features

- **Script Library** — store, organize, and version Bash, PowerShell, Python, and Ansible scripts
- **Syntax-highlighted editor** — CodeMirror 5 editor with per-language highlighting and read-only source viewers
- **AI assistant** — generate, improve, and explain scripts using Claude (Anthropic API); optional, falls back gracefully when unconfigured
- **Live Script Runner** — execute scripts and stream output in real time with cancel support
- **Job Scheduler** — cron-based scheduling with a background service, live next-run preview, and per-job enable/disable
- **Execution History** — log of every run with exit codes and full output
- **Role-based access control** — Admin, Developer, Operator, and Viewer roles
- **User management** — create, edit, and disable users from the Settings page
- **Audit log** — tamper-evident record of all create/edit/delete/run actions
- **System status** — runtime dependency checks and database statistics
- **Comprehensive help system** — dedicated `/help` page, context-sensitive slide-out drawer (accessible from the `?` button in the header), and inline help throughout
- **Persistent storage** — all scripts, jobs, and history survive restarts (SQLite)

## Supported Script Languages

| Language | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Bash | via WSL | `/bin/bash` |
| PowerShell | `powershell.exe` | `pwsh` (PowerShell Core) |
| Python | `python.exe` | `python3` |
| Ansible Playbook | — | `ansible-playbook` |

## Roles

| Role | Scripts | Run Scripts | Schedule Jobs | Settings / Users |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Admin | create / edit / delete | yes | create / edit / delete | yes |
| Developer | create / edit / delete | yes | create / edit / delete | — |
| Operator | view | yes | view | — |
| Viewer | view | — | view | — |

## AI Assistant (optional)

The script editor includes a Claude-powered AI assistant that can generate scripts from a description, improve existing scripts, and explain what a script does in plain language. It requires an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and is completely optional — the editor functions normally without it.

To enable it: **Settings → AI Assistant** → paste your API key → choose a model → Save.

| Model | Best for |
|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | Fast iteration, low cost |
| Sonnet 4.6 | Balanced quality and speed (default) |
| Opus 4.7 | Complex scripts requiring deep reasoning |

API usage is billed per token by Anthropic. See [anthropic.com/pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) for current rates. The key is stored in `automator.db` — secure the file with appropriate filesystem permissions.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dot.net)
- The scripting runtimes you intend to use (`bash`, `pwsh`, `python3`, `ansible-playbook`)

## Getting Started

### Install .NET (Linux — no root required)

```bash
curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --channel 9.0
echo 'export DOTNET_ROOT="$HOME/.dotnet"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Run the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhuebel/Automator.git
cd Automator
dotnet run --project src/Automator.Web
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser.

On first run the app creates `automator.db` in the project directory, seeds the four roles, and creates default users for each role (see table below). Change these credentials immediately in a production deployment.

| Username | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Admin1234!` | Admin |
| `operator` | `Operator1234!` | Operator |
| `viewer` | `Viewer1234!` | Viewer |

Default credentials can be overridden via `appsettings.json` or environment variables before first run:

```json
"DefaultAdmin": { "Username": "myadmin", "Email": "admin@example.com", "Password": "MyStr0ng!" }
```

### Data file location

By default `automator.db` is created in the working directory. To change it:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=/var/lib/automator/automator.db"
}
```

## Cron Schedule Reference

Jobs use standard 5-field cron syntax: `minute hour day month day-of-week`

| Expression | Schedule |
|---|---|
| `* * * * *` | Every minute |
| `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes |
| `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| `0 8 * * *` | Daily at 8 am |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday midnight |
| `0 0 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st |
